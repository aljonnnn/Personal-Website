                FUTURE JOB<br/><br/>
                So my future job is to be a business owner, this is the job I have chosen to be a future job because not only will it help my family but I will also have the knowledge of how to manage a shop or company, this is also the job I have chosen in the future because when there was a pandemic, I already had experience about selling my clothing line and I told myself that when I graduate, I will continue my clothing line business.
